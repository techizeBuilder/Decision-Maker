# Referral Credit System - Updated Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Credit Award From Signup to Calendar Integration
**Before:** Credits were awarded when DM completed package selection during signup
**After:** Credits are only awarded when DM connects their calendar for the first time

### 2. Updated Credit Flow
```
OLD FLOW:
1. DM accepts invitation and signs up
2. DM completes package selection → CREDIT AWARDED ✓
3. DM integrates calendar (optional)

NEW FLOW:
1. DM accepts invitation and signs up
2. DM completes package selection (NO credit awarded)
3. DM integrates calendar → CREDIT AWARDED ✓ (REQUIRED)
```

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Package Selection Endpoint (`/api/decision-maker/package`)
- **Removed** immediate credit award logic
- **Added** message: "Complete calendar integration to award credit to your sales representative"
- **Updated** response to reflect new requirement

#### Calendar Integration Endpoint (`/api/users/:userId`)
- **Added** detection for first-time calendar connection
- **Added** `handleCalendarConnectionCredit()` function
- **Added** referral credit award logic for DMs with `invitedBy` field

#### Credit Storage (`awardCreditToDMCompletion`)
- **Updated** source from "dm_onboarding" to "dm_onboarding_with_calendar"
- **Updated** duplicate check to handle both old and new sources
- **Updated** success message to reflect calendar requirement

### 4. New Function: `handleCalendarConnectionCredit`
```javascript
// Triggered when DM connects calendar for first time
// Awards referral credit to the inviting sales rep
// Logs activity for audit trail
// Handles errors gracefully without breaking calendar connection
```

### 5. Database Changes
- Credit records now use source: "dm_onboarding_with_calendar"
- Activity logs track referral credit awards with metadata
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing credits

### 6. User Experience
- **DM Flow:** Signup → Package Selection → Calendar Integration (credit awarded)
- **Sales Rep:** Gets credit only after DM fully completes onboarding WITH calendar
- **Message:** Clear indication that calendar integration is required for credit

## Benefits

1. **Complete Onboarding:** Ensures DMs fully integrate before credit award
2. **Higher Quality Leads:** Sales reps only get credit for fully engaged DMs
3. **Calendar Adoption:** Incentivizes calendar integration completion
4. **Fair Credit System:** Credit reflects actual value delivery (calendar-connected DM)

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing credits with source "dm_onboarding" remain valid
- New credits use source "dm_onboarding_with_calendar"
- Duplicate prevention works across both sources

## Testing
- Added debug endpoints for testing referral credit flow
- Manual testing confirms credit award on calendar connection
- Integration with existing suspension/flagging system maintained
