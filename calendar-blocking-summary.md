# Calendar Disconnection Call Blocking - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
When a referred Decision Maker (DM) disconnects their calendar, the referring sales representative should be blocked from booking any calls until the DM reconnects their calendar.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Call Booking Validation
Updated `canUserBookCall()` method in `simple-mongodb-storage.ts` to include calendar disconnection check for sales reps:

```javascript
// Check monthly call limit first
// For sales reps, also check if any referred DMs have disconnected calendar
if (userRole === "sales_rep") {
  const calendarBlockResult = await this.checkSalesRepCalendarBlock(userId);
  if (!calendarBlockResult.canBook) {
    return { canBook: false, remainingCalls: callLimit.remainingCalls, message: calendarBlockResult.message };
  }
}
```

### 2. New Function: `checkSalesRepCalendarBlock()`
```javascript
async checkSalesRepCalendarBlock(salesRepId: string): Promise<{ canBook: boolean; message?: string }>
```

**Functionality:**
- Finds all DMs that were invited by the sales rep (`invitedBy: salesRepId`)
- Checks their calendar integration status (`calendarIntegrationEnabled`)
- If any referred DM has disconnected calendar, blocks the sales rep from booking calls
- Provides clear message indicating which DM(s) need to reconnect calendar

### 3. Call Booking Flow Integration
The validation is integrated into the existing call booking endpoint (`POST /api/calls`):

```javascript
// Existing flow:
const repCanBook = await storage.canUserBookCall(salesRepId, "sales_rep");
if (!repCanBook.canBook) {
  return res.status(429).json({
    message: `Sales rep has reached monthly call limit: ${repCanBook.message}`,
    limitType: "sales_rep",
  });
}
```

**Now includes calendar disconnection blocking:**
- Monthly call limit check (existing)
- Calendar disconnection check (new)

### 4. User Experience
**When DM calendar is connected:** Sales rep can book calls normally
**When DM calendar is disconnected:** Sales rep sees message:
- Single DM: "Cannot book calls: Your referred Decision Maker [Name] ([email]) must reconnect their calendar to enable call booking."
- Multiple DMs: "Cannot book calls: Your referred Decision Makers ([Names]) must reconnect their calendars to enable call booking."

## Implementation Details

### Database Queries
- Efficient query using MongoDB find with `invitedBy` field and role filter
- Only selects necessary fields: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `calendarIntegrationEnabled`

### Error Handling  
- Graceful handling of database errors
- Fallback error messages for system failures
- Non-disruptive to other functionalities

### Debug Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/debug/can-book-call` - Test call booking capability
- `POST /api/debug/disconnect-dm-calendar` - Manually disconnect DM calendar for testing

## No Impact on Other Functionality
- Decision Makers are not affected by this blocking logic
- Sales reps with no referred DMs continue to work normally  
- Monthly call limits and other validations remain unchanged
- Calendar connection/disconnection flagging system remains intact
- Referral credit system continues to work independently

## Flow Example
1. Sales rep refers DM → DM signs up and connects calendar → Sales rep can book calls
2. DM disconnects calendar → Sales rep is blocked from booking calls
3. DM reconnects calendar → Sales rep can book calls again

## Benefits
- Ensures calendar integration quality by incentivizing DM reconnection
- Protects platform reliability by preventing calls with disconnected DMs
- Clear messaging helps sales reps understand resolution steps
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding protective layer
