# GOOGLE CALENDAR OAUTH FIX - REQUIRED ACTION

## üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The error "Access blocked: Authorization Error" occurs because your email address is not added to the Test Users list in Google Cloud Console. The OAuth application is in testing mode and only allows approved test users.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: ADD TEST USER
You need to add your email (`mlp.yashkumar@gmail.com`) to the Test Users section in Google Cloud Console.

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Open Google Cloud Console
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to: **APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen**

### Step 2: Add Test User
1. Scroll down to the **"Test users"** section
2. Click **"+ ADD USERS"** button
3. Enter your email: `mlp.yashkumar@gmail.com`
4. Click **"SAVE"**

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
1. Ensure these users are in the Test Users list:
   - `salesrep@techize.com`
   - `mlp.yashkumar@gmail.com`
2. Make sure the app is in **"Testing"** mode (not published)

### Step 4: Test the Integration
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Go back to the decision maker dashboard
3. Click **"Connect Calendar"**
4. You should now be able to complete the OAuth flow

## üîß TECHNICAL VERIFICATION
The application configuration is correct:
- ‚úÖ Client Secret: Present and valid
- ‚úÖ Redirect URI: `https://decisionmaker.shrawantravels.com/api/auth/google/callback`
- ‚úÖ Google Calendar API: Enabled
- ‚úÖ OAuth scopes: Correctly configured

## üìù NOTES
- This is a one-time setup required for testing
- Once your email is added, the OAuth flow will work immediately
- The application code is functioning correctly
- No changes to the codebase are needed

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT
After adding your email to Test Users, you should be able to:
1. Connect Google Calendar successfully
2. View upcoming calendar meetings
3. Join meetings with Google Meet links
4. Sync calendar events in real-time

The Google Calendar integration is fully implemented and working - it just needs your email address to be approved for testing.
